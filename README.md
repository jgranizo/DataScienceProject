The goal is to find whether a student is classified as SWD(Student with Disability) or not SWD. The 3 independent variables are the number of days absent, the total number of students in the specific row that attended school for at least 20 days and the grade that group of students are in.
The dependent variable is a classification of a student who is classified as SWD or not SWD

Used Linear Regression to portray the relationship between the three independent variables, the number of days absent, the total number of students in the specific row that attended school for at least 20 days and the grade that group of students are in. The dependent variable is the SWD status of that group of students surveyed.

Used Logistic Regression to portray the relationship between the three independent variables, the number of days absent, the total number of students in the specific row that attended school for at least 20 days and the grade that group of students are in. The dependent variable is the SWD status of that group of students surveyed.
